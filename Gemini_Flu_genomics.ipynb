trajectories of Influenza A.\n\nAnalyze the following protein alignment from the Hemagglutinin sequence of Influenza A subtype H5, these sequence come from different bird and cattle species as well as humans,\nthe goal is to identify signatures from the sequence belonging to each host species.\nI will provide you with the alignment in a fasta file, where the each line that starts with a \">\" is the header and is separated by \"/\", these headers will bring you information such that\nif you separate the header using the delimiter, the second field is the source of the sample (host), the second from last is the clade, and the last is the date.\nBased on that analyze the file and provide insights such that you extract the following:\n\n- Repetitive sequences and their significance.\n- Higher-order interactiomns (positions where their value distribution depends on other positions).\n- Common mutations or SNPs (Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms) and their possible effect (non-synonymous, synonymous, deletion, etc).\n- Any patterns that could be of medical research interest because it might be a signature of antiviral resistance or immune escape.\n\nGenome
